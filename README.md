# Order-management
Basic requirements
Library that allows customers to order on-line their books and then pick them up physically in the store.
A customer can register himself and must be logged in order to create an order.
An order is composed by one or more books. Each book is related to one category and one or more authors.
The front-end will not be covered in this course, so the deliverable should be an HTTP-REST based API.

As customer, I can ...
➢ Register myself
➢ Update my data
➢ Create orders
➢ Update orders depending on the state
➢ Manage categories, authors and books
➢ Manage users (some actions allowed only to admin)
➢ Manage orders
➢ Audit the system
